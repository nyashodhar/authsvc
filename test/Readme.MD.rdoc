Writing a test
- Functional tests 
- Should be written in the /controllers folder and its filename has to follow the naming convention controller_name_test.rb
- Each test can have a name and everything in the test is after the 'do'
- You make a call to the 'action' you want to test with the 'httpMethod'
- Once you make the call, you can assert the http Status with 
			assert_response :response_code_name
- Get the json response using
			response.body
- You can assert the response using usual assert, please refer to http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html

Test Data
- The test data resides in /fixtures folder
- For example users.yml creates a users table in the test db
- The test data goes into this yml file
- There are multiple ways of defining this data, it can be done as static data or as dynamic data using erb script
- This data will be loaded to database when the test starts
- You can always reset the test db by  giving this command
				'rake db:test:prepare'

Debugging
- For debugging we use 'byebug' gem
- To debug, just drop 
			byebug
	in the code where you want to start debugging
- To go to next step, just type 'next' once the byebug is hit while running the test
- To step into a step, just type 'step'
- To see the values of parameters in the scope of byebug, just type 
				p <parametername>
- The cool thing is, you can type the whole Ruby commands with the p command (similar to rails console) and you can evaluate the results with the parameters in that instance
- To continue, just type 'continue'
- To exit, just type 'exit' or 'kill'
